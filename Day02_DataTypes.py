# How to comment out a line  Control + /

x=5.5;
y=10;
print(x+y); #Statement 1
x=-1;
print (x);
x='hello hello'
y='wow'
print(x)
print(y)
x,y,z=1, "22s",55.5 # Important structure

print("Prints", x, ":",y,":",z) # Statement 2- + does not work - if + is used like java - it simply concatenates i.e. it treats x as a string if it has a preceding string. Compare with Statement1
